## Advice and Guidance

### Advice from fellow chapter leaders

One of the best resources for building a successful ProtoSchool chapter is the experience of other chapter leaders. Check out the [discussion tag in our issue queue](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/organizing/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adiscussion) to find conversations about best practices for event planning and more.  Feel free to open a new issue to share what's working well for you!

While you're at it, take a minute to [introduce yourself to your fellow organizers](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/organizing/issues/26)!

### Tips for creating a welcoming and inclusive environment

As the ProtoSchool community, we take pride in creating a welcoming and inclusive environment for all chapter members, both online and at live events. To that end, we have a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/protoschool/organizing/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for the ProtoSchool community as a whole, as well as one for each individual chapter.

As a chapter organizer, you're responsible for maintaing your chapter's Code of Conduct and responding to reports of any concerning incidents. There are a lot of great resources on why Codes of Conduct are important and how you can navigate any issues that may arise.

- Code of Conduct templates
  - [Conference Code of Conduct](http://confcodeofconduct.com/) (focused on live events)
    - See available [translations](https://github.com/confcodeofconduct/confcodeofconduct.com)
  - [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct) (focused on open source projects and online interactions)
    - See available [translations](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/translations)
  - [Conference Anti-Harassment Policy](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy) from the Ada Initiave


- Guidance for implementation and enforcement

## Physical and digital goodies

### Swag ("stuff we all get") for local events

Let's face it, everyone loves swag!

**ProtoSchool hex stickers** are now available for you to share with attendees at your local events! 🎉 You can [view the sticker design here](/assets/swag/protoschool_sticker_digital_use_only.png). (Note that this image represents the final product and is only for digital use. It does not include the cut lines and bleed required by printers.)

To request ProtoSchool stickers, please email [swag@protocol.ai](swag@protocol.ai) and provide the following details:

- Chapter name
- Quantity of ProtoSchool stickers requested
- Name and mailing address where stickers should be sent
- Event name and date

All requests must be placed **at least 1.5 weeks prior to your event** to ensure we have enough shipping time.

### ProtoSchool logo files

Whether you're building a chapter website or a slide deck for your next presentation, you may want to include the ProtoSchool logo. You can find design files in both svg and png formats, as well as a favicon image for your website, in our [assets directory](/assets).
