## Advice and Guidance

### Advice from fellow chapter leaders

One of the best resources for building a successful ProtoSchool chapter is the experience of other chapter leaders. Check out the [discussion tag in our issue queue](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/organizing/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adiscussion) to find conversations about best practices for event planning and more.  For example, there's a discussion issue all about [planning your first ProtoSchool event](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/organizing/issues/33). Feel free to open a new issue to share what's working well for you!

While you're at it, take a minute to [introduce yourself to your fellow organizers](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/organizing/issues/26)!

### Presentations on managing local communities and leading workshops

At IPFS Camp in 2019, three of our chapter organizers ([@NukeManDan](https://github.com/NukeManDan) from Denver, USA, [@kk3wong](https://github.com/kk3wong) from Hong Kong, and [@stefanhans](https://github.com/stefanhans) from Munich, Germany) led an elective workshop on [**stewarding a local IPFS community through a ProtoSchool chapter**](https://github.com/ipfs/camp/blob/master/CORE_AND_ELECTIVE_COURSES/ELECTIVE_COURSE_F/README.md), which included specific tips for running your local ProtoSchool chapter and leading effective workshops, as well as advice that would be relevant to running an IPFS meetup in another format. Check out the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OLmSfOMjffl7z2ODxHaBcQBmyVEGdt8O7h3bxYv_VVI/edit#slide=id.g4c43915634_2_51)! 

### ProtoSchool community call

All chapter leaders, tutorial authors, and other contributors to the ProtoSchool community are welcome on the  [ProtoSchool community call](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/organizing/issues/47), where we share updates on the steps we're taking to make it easy to get started with decentralized web technologies through both our online tutorials and our local chapter events. Listen in to hear what the project maintainers are working on or share updates from your local chapter. Check out the call's [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/organizing/issues/47) to find video recordings and meeting notes from from past calls, as well as announcements of upcoming calls, or access the meeting invite on the [IPFS Community Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=ipfs.io_eal36ugu5e75s207gfjcu0ae84@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=UTC). The call is open to all and is typically held on Thursdays at at 15:30 UTC (roughly March - October) or 16:30 UTC (roughly November - February), based on season. Please check the issue or calendar above to confirm the current time.

You can find links to meeting notes and recordings of past calls in our [archive](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/roadmap/blob/master/meeting-notes/meeting-notes-and-recordings.md), or view all ProtoSchool videos in our [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuhRWgmPaHtSOTRjgIj2s9wrkItxzA36P).

### Tips for creating a welcoming and inclusive environment

As the ProtoSchool community, we take pride in creating a welcoming and inclusive environment for all chapter members, both online and at live events. To that end, we have a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/protoschool/organizing/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for the ProtoSchool community as a whole, as well as one for each individual chapter.

As a chapter organizer, you're responsible for maintaing your chapter's Code of Conduct and responding to reports of any concerning incidents. There are a lot of great resources on why Codes of Conduct are important and how you can navigate any issues that may arise.

- Code of Conduct templates
  - [Conference Code of Conduct](http://confcodeofconduct.com/) (focused on live events)
    - See available [translations](https://github.com/confcodeofconduct/confcodeofconduct.com)
  - [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct) (focused on open source projects and online interactions)
    - See available [translations](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/translations)
  - [Conference Anti-Harassment Policy](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy) from the Ada Initiave


- Guidance for implementation and enforcement
  - The Ada Initiave offers great [resources for explaining and enforcing anti-harassment policies](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy_resources)

### ProtoSchool slide templates
We've created a ProtoSchool slide deck template which you may copy and use to create slides for events that teach our ProtoSchool tutorials. It includes a wide variety of adaptable slide formats and icons. All files are shared as view only to prevent accidental edits to the template. Please be sure to replace any default presenter names, headshots, etc. with your own information. 

The slides are available in a variety of formats:

### ProtoSchool logo files
