# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project, community,
and events a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants, both online and in person, such as at ProtoSchool events, include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices
* Intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, or inappropriate physical contact
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior at an event, the event organizers may
take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion
from the event with no refund.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

At events, all attendees, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers are required
to agree with and abide by this Code of Conduct.

## Enforcement & Reporting Procedure

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the organizing team at
**[EMAIL](mailto:EMAIL)**. All complaints
will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed
necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The organizing team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

At an event, if you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
or have any other concerns, please contact a member of event staff immediately. Event
staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local
law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment
to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.

Organizers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.

#### Additional reporting options for ProtoSchool workshops
When our organization hosts ProtoSchool workshops, our organizers and participants
are bound by the global ProtoSchool Code of Conduct in addition to all local policies
shared here.  In the case of a conflict of interest with the local organizing team,
of if you feel that the local organizers are not living up to the standards laid out
in this Code of Conduct, please follow the reporting procedures laid out in the broader
[ProtoSchool Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/organizing/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
to reach the project's lead maintainers.
