# Contributing to ProtoSchool

### What is ProtoSchool?

ProtoSchool is an educational community dedicated to making it easy to get started with decentralized technologies. It's a community-driven effort that relies on our many awesome contributors to develop coding tutorials and make this content available at live events around the world with mentor support. We always need more help, and there are lots of ways to pitch in and take an active role in supporting our work.

ProtoSchool has two main initiatives:

-   Building and maintaining tutorials that teach about the protocols underlying the decentralized web, hosted at <https://proto.school/#/>
-   Organizing educational events around the world

As a community, we support the following principles:

-   Beginners should feel welcome
-   Local event leaders should operate autonomously
-   Local event leaders should experiment with new ways to engage their community, and share approaches with other communities over time
-   Events should be affordable and should strive towards diversity and inclusiveness
-   We are 100% open source and like to license things as open source/creative commons

### Where does the name come from?

The "Proto" in ProtoSchool represents the networking protocols that support the decentralized web.

We also take a _lot_ of inspiration from [NodeSchool](https://nodeschool.io/). (Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and all that jazz.)

### Ways to contribute

We welcome new contributors to the ProtoSchool community and there are many ways to help, regardless of your technical background. Check out our website for the [many ways to contribute](https://proto.school/#/contribute).
